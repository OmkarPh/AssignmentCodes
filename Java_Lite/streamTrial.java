            Collecting streams into collections using collect method

            The collect method is used to return the result of the intermediate operations performed on the stream.

            Description 
            Stream.collect() is one of the Java 8's Stream APIâ€˜s terminal methods. It allows us to perform mutable fold operations (repackaging elements to some data structures and applying some additional logic, concatenating them, etc.) on data elements held in a Stream instance.
            The strategy for this operation is provided via Collector interface implementation.

            Using ForEach method in stream
            
            The forEach method is used to iterate through every element of the stream and perform specified action for each of them.
            
            Note:

            Description
            The behavior of this operation is explicitly nondeterministic. For parallel stream pipelines, this operation does not guarantee to respect the encounter order of the stream, as doing so would sacrifice the benefit of parallelism. For any given element, the action may be performed at whatever time and in whatever thread the library chooses. If the action accesses shared state, it is responsible for providing the required synchronization.
